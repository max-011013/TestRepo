Steps to repeat
1. Create A .net framework Web API
2. Update Nuget Packages

Let me give a brief introduction about the routing of this project.
In this APP_Start folder we have Routeconfig file which manages the routing of the whole web application
and this webapiConfig contains all the routing for the API's

Now to use Swagger we add swagger to our wep application
To do that we go to Nuget package and download SwashBuckle to implement swagger.

Now we run our program to run swagger,
to see swagger we simply go /swagger
It actually already running
now we have account and values, so what it is  our documentations so 
if you want to look what account or value controller has for end point so lets say 

for values  it has 5 end points
If we click on Get, it shows that the api will return will return this type of Structure
Now we click on Try it out, So here we are getting a message that authorization is required that is a user must be logged in
Its also show the requested URL, response header and response code

Now One thing when we checked on Account there is nowhere to log in, we have register but no get token we have to fix that as we 
are not able to log in using Oauth we have setup

Now we have to configure Swagger so under the APP_Start folder we now have a swaggerconfig file,
this file allows us to uncomment thing to change something 
so they have documented in such a way that we can easily make changes 




the type of body that we send along the post api call
